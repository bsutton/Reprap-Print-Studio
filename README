3dc allows the conversion between a number of popular 3d CAD file formats.

3dc was specifically written to support work with the reprap 3d printer and is part of a
multi-material tool chain that I'm developing.

Compiling
-------------------
Run
cd convertor
mvn install

The compiled classes will be in the convertor/target/classes directory.

Usage
-------------------
$ ./run.sh input_type input_file output_type output_file

Where input_type and output_type is one of:
amf, stl, stlb, or obj

Known Issues
-------------------
The OBJ parser does not currently support materials or textures.
